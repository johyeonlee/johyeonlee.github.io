          <p><strong>Karrot</strong> is a hyper-local community app that connects neighbors to buy, sell, and share items and services. Launched in South Korea in 2015, Karrot quickly grew in popularity by fostering trust and convenience within local communities. Its success is attributed to its user-friendly interface, strong focus on local interactions, and the ability to build a sense of community among users. By addressing the needs of hyper-local markets, Karrot has expanded rapidly, making it a go-to platform for neighborhood transactions and services.</p>
          <p>However, the adoption of <strong>Karrot Pay</strong>, a feature designed for seamless transactions, remains lower than desired due to limited user awareness and perceived benefits.</p>

      <h2>Sprint Goals</h2>
      <p class="hugeMargin">The main goal of this sprint was to seek for a way to increase the local adoption of Karrot Pay. Our team aimed to increase the usage of Karrot Pay by enhancing its utility within local businesses.</p>
      <h3>Why this problem?</h3>
      <p class="hugeMargin">Despite Karrot's success in connecting individuals for personal transactions, the adoption of Karrot Pay in local businesses was lagging. This posed a significant barrier to achieving Karrot's mission of becoming a hyper-local community platform not just for personal but also for business transactions.</p>
      <h3>Why specifically local businesses?</h3>
      <p class="hugeMargin">While Karrot Pay can be used for secondhand transactions between users, we recognized that leveraging the existing local business feature could boost the frequency of Karrot Pay transactions by offering greater potential for sustained usage.</p><br>
      <p class="hugeMargin">To achieve this, we focused on finding a solution that would incentivize both businesses and users to adopt Karrot Pay more actively. We hypothesized that offering temporary, exclusive benefits through coupons could drive initial usage and demonstrate the value of Karrot Pay to both businesses and users.</p>

      <p class="hugeMargin">My journey began upon discovering deficiencies in the current UI, including a cluttered layout lacking clear sections, outdated design with huge images, and the presence of multiple duplicate links on a single page. These issues resulted in a disjointed user experience, making navigation confusing and impeding access to desired content. This led me to create a more intuitive and efficient browsing experience for users.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Crafting a Clear Path to Guide Users</h2>
        <p class="hugeMargin">To solve the problem, I pursued a comprehensive redesign strategy for the website interface involving restructuring the layout, optimizing image sizes, and removing duplicate links. By addressing these issues, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience, making it more intuitive and efficient for users to access the desired content seamlessly.</p>

        <h2>Engaging Users with Clear Visual Design</h2>
        <p class="hugeMargin">To visually speak to new customers, I focused on keeping the balance between brand integrity and to provide a refreshing look to the customers.<br><br>Throughout this process, I extensively researched design principles, utilizing resources such as Nielsen Norman Group's usability guidelines and Material Design's best practices to uphold design standards and objectives. Additionally, I analyzed websites sharing similar objectives, such as those belonging to logistics companies, in order to gather valuable insights and refine our approach.</p>
        <video class="detail" src="images/dhl_toggle.mov" width="100%" controls></video>
        <p class="hugeMargin">One strategy I implemented involved replacing traditional links with toggle menus, enhancing user navigation by consolidating multiple options within a single interface. This approach not only reduces the need for multiple page loads but also enables smoother access to various features without overwhelming the user with unnecessary clicks or redirects.</p>
        <img src="images/dhl_visualex.png" width="100%">
        <p class="hugeMargin">I further iterated on improving the <i>Our Division</i> section, transitioning from images to illustrations initially, and finally simplifying it to icons in the last iteration. This evolution aimed to enhance visual clarity and streamline the presentation of division information for improved user engagement.</p>

      <h2>Lessons & Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="hugeMargin">Looking back, I'm grateful for how the beginning of the year served as a catalyst for my growth as a designer. At times, it felt overwhelming due to the abundance of information on the website. However, overcoming these challenges allowed me to expand my understanding beyond design and visual elements, emphasizing the importance of effectively conveying meaningful information to users.<br><br>The five-month period following graduation offered me a harmonious blend of professional development and personal fulfillment, liberating me from the rigors of university life and enabling me to fully immerse myself in various endeavors. I eagerly anticipate continuing to evolve and embrace new challenges in the journey ahead.</p>
