          <p>After graduation, I immersed myself in refining my user experience design skills while reconnecting with my family and relishing my time in South Korea. One project that stood out as particularly stimulating was the redesign of the DHL website, where I could apply my skills in a practical setting while blending my passion for design with real-world challenges.</p>
          <p>As an international student during my time at university, I frequently utilized DHL's international package delivery services for shipments from my family in Korea and friends in various countries. Given my, and my friends' frequent interactions with the website, I was inspired to modernize the current DHL website with a fresh new look.</p>

        <p class="hugeMargin">The necessity for a website redesign lies in its pursuit of minimalistic design, heightened user experience, and enhanced aesthetic appeal. This call to action arises from the current site's outdated appearance, ineffective use of imagery, and lack of intuitive navigation. A refined redesign initiative seeks to address these deficiencies, ensuring a seamless browsing experience that resonates with modern users and elevates DHL's online presence within the logistics industry.</p>
