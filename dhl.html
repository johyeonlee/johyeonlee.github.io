          <p>After graduation, I immersed myself in refining my user experience design skills while reconnecting with my family and relishing my time in South Korea. One project that stood out as particularly stimulating was the redesign of the DHL website, where I could apply my skills in a practical setting while blending my passion for design with real-world challenges.</p>
          <p>As an international student during my time at university, I frequently utilized DHL's international package delivery services for shipments from my family in Korea and friends in various countries. Given frequent interactions with the website, I was inspired to modernize the current DHL website with a fresh new look.</p>

      <p class="hugeMargin">My journey began upon discovering deficiencies in the current UI, including a cluttered layout lacking clear sections, outdated design with huge images, and the presence of multiple duplicate links on a single page. These issues resulted in a disjointed user experience, making navigation confusing and impeding access to desired content. This led me to create a more intuitive and efficient browsing experience for users.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Crafting a Clear Path to Guide Users</h2>
        <p class="hugeMargin">To solve the problem, I pursued a comprehensive redesign strategy for the website interface involving restructuring the layout, optimizing image sizes, and removing duplicate links. By addressing these issues, I aimed to enhance the overall user experience, making it more intuitive and efficient for users to access the desired content seamlessly.</p>

        <h2>Engaging Users with Clear Visual Design</h2>
        <p class="hugeMargin">To visually speak to new customers, I focused on keeping the balance between brand integrity and to provide a refreshing look to the customers.<br><br>Throughout this process, I extensively researched design principles, utilizing resources such as Nielsen Norman Group's usability guidelines and Material Design's best practices to uphold design standards and objectives. Additionally, I analyzed websites sharing similar objectives, such as those belonging to logistics companies, in order to gather valuable insights and refine our approach.</p>
        <video class="detail" src="images/dhl_toggle.mov" width="100%" controls></video>
        <p class="hugeMargin">One strategy I implemented involved replacing traditional links with toggle menus, enhancing user navigation by consolidating multiple options within a single interface. This approach not only reduces the need for multiple page loads but also enables smoother access to various features without overwhelming the user with unnecessary clicks or redirects.</p>
        <img src="images/dhl_visualex.png" width="100%">
        <p class="hugeMargin">I further iterated on improving the <i>Our Division</i> section, transitioning from images to illustrations initially, and finally simplifying it to icons in the last iteration. This evolution aimed to enhance visual clarity and streamline the presentation of division information for improved user engagement.</p>

      <h2>Lessons & Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="hugeMargin">Looking back, I'm grateful for how the beginning of the year served as a catalyst for my growth as a designer. At times, it felt overwhelming due to the abundance of information on the website. However, overcoming these challenges allowed me to expand my understanding beyond design and visual elements, emphasizing the importance of effectively conveying meaningful information to users.<br><br>The five-month period following graduation offered me a harmonious blend of professional development and personal fulfillment, liberating me from the rigors of university life and enabling me to fully immerse myself in various endeavors. I eagerly anticipate continuing to evolve and embrace new challenges in the journey ahead.</p>
